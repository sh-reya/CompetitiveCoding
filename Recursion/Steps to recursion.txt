3 Steps to solve problem using reccursion

1. Find the Base Case (Simplest Case)
Think about the simplest possible input for this function.

2.Find Relation
Think how a larger problem can be solved with the help of Base case solution.

3.Generalise
Make a generalised function using both the above function.
